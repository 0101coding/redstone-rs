# Redstone-rs

## Implementation of Redstone protocol
Redstone Project is a p2p custom blockchain implementation, comprised of a network of interconnected subchains providing improved speed and scalability over conventional cryptocurrenys.
This is the offical implemention of the redstone protocol. It is written in rust. Protocol is subject to frequent change and as such no complete documention exists (however it is in the works) It is currently not ready for usage.

## How to compile

### Linux

#### Prerequisites

Redstone makes abundant use of Rust's syntax extensions and other advanced, unstable features. Because of this, you will need to use a nightly version of Rust. If you already have a working installation of the latest Rust nightly, feel free to skip to the next section.
To install a nightly version of Rust, we recommend using rustup. Install rustup by following the instructions on its website. Once rustup is installed, configure Rust nightly as your default toolchain by running the command:

```
rustup default nightly
```

To build redstone you also need installed dependencies listed bellow:

```
openssl
```
**To build GUI wallet on debian**:
```
sudo apt-get install xorg-dev
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxext-dev libxft-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxrender-dev libxfixes-dev libpango1.0-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
sudo apt-get install libavutil-dev
sudo apt-get install libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libspeechd-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev
```

```
GCC
Cmake
```
** Fedora **
``
sudo yum groupinstall "X Software Development" && yum install pango-devel libXinerama-devel libX11-devel libXinerama-devel-1.1.4-9.fc35
pango-devel
``

##### Generic Linux

Ensure you have the dependencies listed above.

```bash
git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/RedStoneCoin/redstone-rs/
cd redstone-rs/src/node # for node
cd redstone-rs/src/wallet # for Wallet

cargo build --release
```

After the completion, the binaries will be in the `target/release` folder.

```bash
cd target/debug
./redstone-node
# or wallet
./redstone-wallet
```


# Security Policy
