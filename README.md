## How to compile

### Linux

#### Prerequisites

Rust makes abundant use of Rust's syntax extensions and other advanced, unstable features. Because of this, you will need to use a nightly version of Rust. If you already have a working installation of the latest Rust nightly, feel free to skip to the next section.
To install a nightly version of Rust, we recommend using rustup. Install rustup by following the instructions on its website. Once rustup is installed, configure Rust nightly as your default toolchain by running the command:

```
rustup default nightly
```

To build redstone you also need installed dependencies listed bellow:

```
openssl
```

```
Cmake
```

##### Generic Linux

Ensure you have the dependencies listed above.

```bash
git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/avrio-project/avrio-rs/
cd redstone-rs/src/node # for node
cd redstone-rs/src/wallet # for Wallet

cargo build --release
```

After the completion, the binaries will be in the `target/release` folder.

```bash
cd target
./redstone-node
# or wallet
./redstone-wallet
```
